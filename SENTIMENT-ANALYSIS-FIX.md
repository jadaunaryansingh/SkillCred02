# Sentiment Analysis Fix Guide

## Problem Identified

The sentiment analysis was not working properly because:

1. **Hardcoded API Key**: The Google Cloud Natural Language API key was hardcoded in the code, which is a security risk and likely expired/invalid
2. **Poor Error Handling**: When the API failed, it silently fell back to basic keyword analysis
3. **Incorrect Score Calculation**: The sentiment score conversion from Google's -1 to 1 scale was flawed
4. **Missing Fallback Logic**: No proper handling when the API was unavailable

## What I Fixed

### 1. Environment Variable Configuration
- Removed hardcoded API key
- Added proper environment variable support
- Created `env-template.txt` showing required configuration

### 2. Improved Google Cloud API Integration
- Better error handling for different HTTP status codes
- Proper logging of API responses and errors
- Fallback to local analysis when API fails
- Support for both document-level and sentence-level sentiment

### 3. Enhanced Local Sentiment Analysis
- Improved keyword detection with more comprehensive word lists
- Added negation word handling (e.g., "not good" = negative)
- Added intensifier word handling (e.g., "very good" = more positive)
- Text pattern analysis for punctuation and capitalization
- Better score normalization

### 4. Better Debugging
- Added comprehensive logging throughout the sentiment analysis process
- Created test script to verify functionality
- Better error messages and fallback handling

## How to Fix Your Setup

### Step 1: Get Google Cloud API Key
1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select existing one
3. Enable the "Natural Language API"
4. Go to "Credentials" → "Create Credentials" → "API Key"
5. Copy the API key

### Step 2: Configure Environment Variables
1. Create a `.env` file in your project root
2. Add your API key:
   ```
   GOOGLE_CLOUD_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
   ```

### Step 3: Test the Fix
1. Restart your server
2. Run the test script: `node test-sentiment.js`
3. Check the console logs for detailed sentiment analysis information

## Expected Results

With a valid Google Cloud API key, you should see:
- Accurate sentiment scores based on actual text content
- Different scores for clearly positive/negative/neutral texts
- Proper fallback to local analysis if API is unavailable
- Detailed logging showing the analysis process

## Troubleshooting

### If API calls still fail:
1. Check your API key is correct
2. Verify Natural Language API is enabled in Google Cloud
3. Check your billing is set up (API has usage limits)
4. Look at server console logs for specific error messages

### If sentiment is still generic:
1. Check that the API key is being loaded from environment variables
2. Verify the API is returning proper responses
3. Check the local fallback analysis is working

## Files Modified

- `server/utils/sentiment-analysis.ts` - Fixed API integration and local analysis
- `server/routes/enhanced-sentiment.ts` - Added better logging
- `env-template.txt` - Environment variable template
- `test-sentiment.js` - Test script for verification

## Next Steps

1. Get your Google Cloud API key
2. Create the `.env` file
3. Restart your server
4. Test with the provided test script
5. Verify sentiment analysis is working in your application

The sentiment analysis should now provide much more accurate and varied results based on the actual content of your text!
